    <h1>How Egypt Eradicated Malaria and Secured WHO Certification.</h1>

    <p>
      The World Health Organization (WHO) has certified Egypt as malaria-free,
      with Khaled Abdel Ghaffar, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of
      Health and Population, receiving an official certificate to commemorate
      this significant achievement.<br />
      “Malaria is as old as Egyptian civilization itself, but the disease that
      plagued pharaohs now belongs to its history,<br />” Tedros Adhanom
      Ghebreyesus, WHO chief said, highlighting that this achievement reflects a
      century of dedication from the Egyptian government and its people.<br />
      Globally, a total of 44 countries and one territory have been certified
      malaria-free.<br />
      Egypt is the first country to reach this milestone since 2010 and the
      third in the Mediterranean region, following the United Arab Emirates
      (UAE) and Morocco.<br />
      Malaria, a life-threatening disease transmitted by certain types of
      mosquitoes, poses significant risks to young children, infants, pregnant
      women, travelers, and individuals with HIV or AIDS.<br />
      Symptoms can range from mild, such as fever, chills, and headaches, to
      severe, including fatigue, confusion, seizures, and difficulty
      breathing.<br />
      While predominantly found in tropical regions, malaria is both preventable
      and treatable According to WHO, in 2022 there were an estimated 249
      million malaria cases and 608,000 deaths worldwide across 85 countries.<br />
      The African Region bore a disproportionate share of this burden,
      accounting for 94 percent of cases, or 233 million, and 95 percent of
      deaths, totaling 580,000. WHO grants malaria elimination certification
      when a country has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that indigenous
      malaria transmission by Anopheles mosquitoes, the main transmitters of
      malaria to humans, has been interrupted nationwide for at least three
      consecutive years and has demonstrated the capacity to prevent its
      re-establishment.<br />
      Egypt’s successful eradication of malaria follows more than a century of
      efforts to eliminate a disease that has afflicted the nation since ancient
      times, as traces of genetic evidence of malaria were found in Egyptian
      mummies as far back as 4,000 B.C. With a significant portion of the
      population residing along the banks of the Nile River and malaria rates
      soaring to as high as 40 percent in the 1920s, the Egyptian government
      recognized the situation’s urgency. <br />The state banned the cultivation
      of rice and crops near residential areas to minimize human contact with
      mosquitoes and curb the spread of malaria. In 1930, malaria was officially
      classified as a notifiable disease, leading to the establishment of the
      nation’s first malaria control station dedicated to diagnosis, treatment,
      and surveillance.<br />
      However, by 1942, malaria cases in Egypt had spiked to more than 3 million
      as a result of the Second World War population displacement and the
      disruption of medical supplies and services. Egypt controlled the malaria
      outbreak by establishing 16 treatment divisions and recruiting more than
      4000 health workers.<br />
      In 1969, the completion of the Aswan Dam introduced a new malaria threat
      to Egypt, as the dam’s stagnant waters became ideal breeding grounds for
      mosquitoes.<br />
      In response, Egypt, working in partnership with Sudan, initiated an
      extensive vector control program and strengthened public health
      surveillance to identify and address potential malaria outbreaks quickly.
      With malaria under control by 2001, Egypt’s Ministry of Health and
      Population redirected its efforts toward preventing the resurgence of the
      disease and its local transmission.<br />
      Egypt continues to this day to provide malaria diagnosis and treatment
      free of charge to all Egyptians and residents, regardless of their legal
      status.<br />
      Health professionals across Egypt are trained to detect and screen for
      malaria, including at border crossings, in coordination with Sudan and
      neighboring countries, helping to prevent the resurgence of local
      transmission and positioning the nation for official malaria-free
      certification.<br />
      “Receiving the malaria elimination certificate today is not the end of the
      journey but the beginning of a new phase,”<br />
      Egypt’s Deputy Prime Minister, Khaled Abdel Ghaffar, said. “We must now
      work tirelessly and vigilantly to sustain our achievement […] our
      continued multisectoral efforts will be critical to preserving Egypt’s
      malaria-free status.” Egypt’s malaria-free status is a notable milestone
      in public health that follows years of diligent efforts, with health
      officials at its center, continuously focusing on prevention to ensure
      that malaria stays in the past.
